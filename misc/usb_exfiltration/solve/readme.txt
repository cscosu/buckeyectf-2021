With wireshark you can see that there is some traffic to 2 different endpoints on the USB (1.76.1 and 1.76.3). In particular there is a series of URB_BULK out transfers to 1.76.3 which are pretty large (16448 bytes except for the last 2) where wireshark detects leftover capture data. In fact, the first few bytes of the first leftover capture data section matches the magic bytes for a zip file! If you select all those packets (just the packet from the host to 1.76.3, not the acknowledgement responses from 1.76.3 back to the host) and File->Export Packet Dissections->As JSON you can get a file like transfer.json in the src folder. From there you can write a python script (like solve.py in the solve folder) which will parse the json, pull out the leftover capture data for each packet, convert to bytes, concatenate them all together, and write out the result as a zip file. That zip file contains a file with the base64-encoded flag.
